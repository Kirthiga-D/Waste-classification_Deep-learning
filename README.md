# GreenAI: Optimizing Waste Management with Transfer Learning and Deep Learning Models

### Project Overview
GreenAI is a deep learning-based waste classification system developed to enhance recycling efficiency and promote environmental sustainability. This project explores the use of various neural network models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, to categorize waste materials from images. It focuses on classifying waste into categories such as recyclable and non-recyclable, using image data sourced from public datasets. This system aims to support the automation of waste sorting, thereby reducing the need for manual sorting in recycling operations.

## Introduction
GreenAI leverages transfer learning and deep learning techniques to classify waste images accurately. It prioritizes models like CNN, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, which have demonstrated high classification accuracy (>90%) and suitability for real-time applications in resource-constrained environments. This project does not currently integrate IoT or edge computing devices but can potentially extend to such use cases.

## Objectives
The main goals of GreenAI are:
1. To develop a waste classification system that accurately categorizes recyclable and non-recyclable materials.
2. To evaluate the performance of deep learning models on waste classification tasks and select those with high accuracy and computational efficiency.
3. To provide a scalable solution for integrating automated waste sorting systems into existing recycling operations.

## Methodology
The methodology follows these key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Image data for waste materials are collected from open-source datasets like TrashNet and augmented with additional data using web scraping.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The collected images are resized to 224x224 pixels and normalized. Data augmentation techniques such as random rotation, flipping, and zoom are applied to improve model robustness.
3. **Model Selection**: Several models, including ANN, CNN, VGG16, ResNet, and MobileNetV2, are tested. MobileNetV2 is particularly emphasized for its balance between accuracy and efficiency.
4. **Evaluation**: Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Results
The results show that CNN, ResNet, and MobileNetV2 models achieved classification accuracy of over 90%, with ResNet reaching 94%. The following table summarizes the performance of each model:

| Model       | Accuracy (%) | Precision | Recall | F1 Score |
|-------------|--------------|-----------|--------|----------|
| ANN         | 80           | 0.78      | 0.76   | 0.77     |
| CNN         | 85           | 0.84      | 0.83   | 0.83     |
| VGG16       | 92           | 0.91      | 0.90   | 0.91     |
| ResNet      | 94           | 0.93      | 0.94   | 0.94     |
| MobileNetV2 | 91           | 0.90      | 0.91   | 0.91     |

## Future Implications
Future work could include:
- Integrating GreenAI into edge devices for real-time waste classification.
- Exploring the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to generate synthetic data for underrepresented classes.
- Expanding the system to utilize multi-modal data, including textual data from waste labels or sensor information.

## Conclusion
GreenAI demonstrates that deep learning, particularly CNN-based models and transfer learning approaches, can significantly enhance the accuracy of waste classification. This project has the potential to contribute to sustainable waste management practices by automating the sorting process.
